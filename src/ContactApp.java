        Contact contact = new Contact();

        // Default contacts from Contact class/contacts.txt:

     //contact.defaultContacts(); we are now editing the document directly
        // note: kyle would like to add a way to update a contact then to delete a specific dublicate contact
   //kristen would like to make the search contacts able to prompt to ADD a contact if the user's search matches no existing contact

//OKAY SO: if the contacts.txt is blank we will still be able to run and view the contacts but after we hit "View contacts it will display the empty file then stop running:
    //
        // Main Menu:

        contact.mainMenu();
